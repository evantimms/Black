# Black

## A Project By Evan


I used to be awful with money. After years of trying every trick in the book to save more and spend less, I eventually 
started to learn that the key to saving money was consistency. Consistently monitoring how much you are spending and taking
care to budget and track purchases made managing your expenses and saving far easier. The problem for me however, is that 
most software out there for person budgeting was way to dang complicated. I found it was difficult to use, and oftentimes 
was slow and outdated.

Black is personal expense tracking - made simple, easy to use and accessible. The software is built neaty into a web app that
can be accessed via the website, or by downloading the extension on the chrome store. Black monitores your purchases and keeps
a simple easy to read budget that you customize to suit your needs. It makes online shopping a breeze, at checkout you can simply
add the purchase to Black and it will update your budget, and warn you when that extra pair of shoes might be a little more than
you can afford.

So keep it simple, and stay in the black.

*For the geeks out there: Black is built in Express 4.16 and features full integration with MongoDB, authentication with
PassportJS and real time data tracking and display with CanvasJS (Later to be upgraded to D3.js).*
